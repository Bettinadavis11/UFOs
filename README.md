# Overview of Project
Dana's website is working as requested; however, we'd like to make it more dynamic and add more filters for multiple criteria such as date, city, state, country and shape.

# Results:
For Dana to locate the information she is looking for, she would need to follow these steps:
* Visit the website
* Enter the information she has available to search in the fields located to the left of the page. For example, I entered in the "City" field, "antioch" which is a city close to me, and it populated the following information (see image below).

* She could also enter a date on the "Date" field such as 1/2/2010 as shown in the image below. However, the information would include sightings from all the cities within our data.js file.

# Summary:
* One drawback that I could think of, is how case sensitive is our website. For example, if I enter the name "Antioch" in the search field, our website would not return any results (please see image below).

* One recomendation I could think of to improve our website would be to have a more defined return in case our website doesn't match any criteria in our search. For example, a more clear "No results found" statement is displayed rather than an empty website.

* Another recomendation would be to have a drop-down menu. That way, it would prevent from getting any unnecessary errors when entering information in the search fields.
